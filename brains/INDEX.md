## Vault

- Keys live in `secrets.local.json` on this machine (gitignored). Same idea as `.env`. Not markdown. Not chat.
- Site logins live in that same vault. You → Keys → Site logins, or approve them on a login card when a job hits a wall.
- Unlock PIN in You → Settings gates the board. Do not paste keys or passwords into chat.
- OpenCode (three Go wallets, same catalog): shared pool first, then SAA Homes / Conversion, then ListLogic. OpenRouter PAYG last.
- Seats are Auto unless you pin: Auto uses Muse Spark Contributor Free while OpenCode lists it, then Chat flash / Think-Code Arena / Ops cheap Go. Empty Chat can still be Board (INDEX) for free status.
- CEO pins: openbot + Nadia → shared pool. SAA Homes → SAA Go. ListLogic → ListLogic Go. If that wallet is empty the instance chain is next.
- Hermes native: Nous Portal subscription. Subscribe at portal.nousresearch.com/r/adam-schwartz. Connect with `hermes portal` or paste `NOUS_API_KEY`. Not in this vault yet, so Auto is Go then OpenRouter.
- PAYG: OpenRouter after the three Go wallets are empty, plus OpenCode Zen after Go quota
- Not imported: Telegram, SMTP, GitHub, Meta — those stay on Railway. TOTP and CAPTCHA still stop on this screen.

## Railway Hermes (source)

- ListLogic Hermes
- SAA Homes Hermes
- SAA Conversion Hermes
- Each already had a Go key and the same OpenRouter fallback. Lab keys stay on those Hermes instances if they were already there.

# INDEX

Source of truth for this OpenBot instance. Status questions read this file only.

Now: Pulled today's Railway Hermes state into local CEO homes. Board still local. Railway OpenBot deploy next.
Last: Slim-pulled ListLogic, SAA Homes, and Nadia memory/cron/sessions from Railway. Did not start a local Telegram gateway.
Next: OpenBot git remote + Railway project URL. Pause Railway Hermes gateways before local cron.
Blocker: Do not start a local Hermes gateway while Railway Telegram is live. SAA state.db was locked on extract.

## Vault

- Keys live in `secrets.local.json` on this machine (gitignored). Same idea as `.env`. Not markdown. Not chat.
- Site logins live in that same vault. You → Keys → Site logins, or approve them on a login card when a job hits a wall.
- Unlock PIN in You → Settings gates the board. Do not paste keys or passwords into chat.
- OpenCode (three Go wallets, same catalog): shared pool first, then SAA Homes / Conversion, then ListLogic. OpenRouter PAYG last.
- Seats are Auto unless you pin: Chat flash, Think/Code Fable-class, Research Sol, Ops a cheap Go model. Empty Chat can still be Board (INDEX) for free status.
- CEO pins: openbot + Nadia → shared pool. SAA Homes → SAA Go. ListLogic → ListLogic Go. If that wallet is empty the instance chain is next.
- Hermes native: Nous Portal subscription. Subscribe at portal.nousresearch.com/r/adam-schwartz. Connect with `hermes portal` or paste `NOUS_API_KEY`. Not in this vault yet, so Auto is Go then OpenRouter.
- PAYG: OpenRouter after the three Go wallets are empty, plus OpenCode Zen after Go quota
- Not imported: Telegram, SMTP, GitHub, Meta — those stay on Railway. TOTP and CAPTCHA still stop on this screen.

## Railway Hermes (source)

- ListLogic Hermes
- SAA Homes Hermes
- SAA Conversion Hermes
- Each already had a Go key and the same OpenRouter fallback. Lab keys stay on those Hermes instances if they were already there.

# INDEX

Source of truth for this OpenBot instance. Status questions read this file only.

Now: OpenBot saa-homes gateway is up (PID 103). lead-attribution-brief succeeded. Do not Accept parked restore cards.
Last: Railway OpenBot now supervises with hermes gateway run. warm_engines stays OpenCode web + Hermes dashboard.
Next: One more gateway-shutdown retry later. Skip conversion-surge. Hold PR #48. Open https://github.com/adamsch0100/openbot/compare/master...board-pulse-cron-noise
Blocker: saved-search-alerts-digest 401 is saahomes CRON_SECRET on the site API — not OpenBot glue. Last digest run was ok.

## Vault

- Keys live in `secrets.local.json` on this machine (gitignored). Same idea as `.env`. Not markdown. Not chat.
- Site logins live in that same vault. You → Keys → Site logins, or approve them on a login card when a job hits a wall.
- Unlock PIN in You → Settings gates the board. Do not paste keys or passwords into chat.
- OpenCode (three Go wallets, same catalog): shared pool first, then SAA Homes / Conversion, then ListLogic wallet if still in the keyring. OpenRouter PAYG last.
- Seats are Auto unless you pin: Auto stays on OpenCode Go (flash). Muse Spark on an OpenRouter id is not Auto. OpenRouter PAYG is last after the three Go wallets. Empty Chat can still be Board (INDEX) for free status.
- CEO pins: openbot + Support → shared pool. SAA Homes → SAA Go. Nadia and ListLogic CEOs are retired from routing (folders stay on disk).
- Hermes native: Nous Portal subscription. Subscribe at portal.nousresearch.com/r/adam-schwartz. Connect with `hermes portal` or paste `NOUS_API_KEY`. Not in this vault yet, so Auto is Go then OpenRouter.
- PAYG: OpenRouter after the three Go wallets are empty, plus OpenCode Zen after Go quota
- Not imported: Telegram, SMTP, GitHub, Meta — those stay on Railway. TOTP and CAPTCHA still stop on this screen.

## Railway Hermes (source)

- ListLogic Hermes
- SAA Homes Hermes
- SAA Conversion Hermes
- Each already had a Go key and the same OpenRouter fallback. Lab keys stay on those Hermes instances if they were already there.
